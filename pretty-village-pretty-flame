Lepa sela lepo gore (1995)

The Yugoslavian Civil War of the 1990s is one of the most poorly understood events of recent history. Beginning with the 10-Day War in the Summer of 1991, a brief conflict that killed under 100 people and ended with Slovenia gaining its independence, it quickly spiraled into the far bloodier Croatian War of Independence, which killed tens of thousands of people and displaced over 300,000 civilians, mostly Serbs. The Clinton Administration's decision to bomb Belgrade in 1999, while largely forgotten in the United States, remains a source of bitterness in Serbia, where it's largely considered a terrorist attack no different from 9/11. In any event, it solved nothing since conficts between Serbs and Albanians in North Kosovo continue to this day. But it's the Bosnian war, which took place between 1992 and 1995, and which included the massacre at Sbrebenica and the three-year-long siege of Sarajevo, that's largely responsible for the villainous reputation that Serbs enjoy in Western Europe and North America.

Even though Lepa sela lepo gore was filmed in the breakaway Republika Srpska, in territory controlled by Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić, it makes no attempt to deny Serbian atrocities committed during the civil war in Bosnia. Quite the contrary, it rubs our faces in them. The title, roughly translated as "pretty villages burn beautifully," a quote from Louis Ferdinand Celine's autobiographical novel Long Day's Journey into Night, refers to the practice of burning down Muslim villages to drive out, and ethnically cleanse, their inhabitants. But it also pushes back against the idea so popular in the United States and Western Europe that the Bosnian War was a simplistic melodrama of good versus evil, of innocent Muslims victimized by bestial Orthodox Christians. Nothing, the director Srđan Dragojević and screenwriter Vanja Bulić seem to be telling us, is ever that simple. Not only are they unclear about exactly "who started it," they have no real confidence that Yugoslavia was even worth saving in the first place. 

Lepa sela lepo gore opens in 1971 at the aptly named Tunnel of Brotherhood and Unity -- for the movie is ultimately about the failure of brotherhood and unity -- near the Bosnian city of Goražde. The dedication of the tunnel, reported to us in the form of a mock newsreal and presided over by local Bosnian communist bigwig Džemal Bijedić, is supposed to inaugurate a long reign of multi-ethnic harmony and ethnic progress. But nothing goes as planned. At the ribbon cutting ceremony a communist party official accidentally slices through his own thumb, spraying the girl holding the ribbon with blood, and providing an ominous glimpse of the future. Only ten years later the tunnel has already fallen into such disrepair and decay that Milan and Halil, two young boys, one an Orthodox Christian Serb, the other a Bosniak Muslim, staring at the entrance, but fearing to enter because they believe that a Drekavac, an ogre from South Slavic mythology, is sleeping inside, and will destroy the entire village if woken up. The symbolism is clear. The Drekavac represents not only the coming civil war, but the brotherhood of Milan and Halil, one of whom may have been brought up to worship Jesus, the other to bow to Mecca 5 times a day, but both of whom are South Slavs who share a common pre-Christian mythology. 

According to the Bible, the first violent act between humans was between brothers. For most people in North America and Western Europe, the Serbs are Cain, and the Bosniak Muslims the innocent Abel. The Serbs, therefore, are the outcasts of Europe and Serbia the only European country that's been bombed since the Second World War. Serbian generals and government officials get prosecuted for war crimes in a way that American, British and French government officials, many of whom are guilty of crimes far than Slobodan Milosovic or Ratko Mladić, don't. In the Book of Genesis, Cain kills Abel because God accepts Abel's offering but not his. For Milan and Halil, the hatred comes gradually, ominously, like a slight chill in the air that indicates a coming storm. The problem isn't so much that God favors one brother over the other, but that God, Marshall Tito, is dead, and his children have never quite learned how to get along witout him. If at age 10 Milan and Halil looked so much alike you couldn't tell them apart, we begin to notice differences in their appearance, not subtle but big differences. Milan, played by Dragan Bjelogrlić who looks a bit like a young Russell Crow, is square jawed and masculine. Halil, played by Nikola Pejaković, who almost reminds me of a blond, blue-eyed John Belushi, is round-faced, soft, feminine and pleasure loving but with a terrifying undercurrent of violence just beneath the surface. The fault line between the masculine west and the orientalized east has opened up right under their feet. The Drekavac is loose. The village will be destroyed.
