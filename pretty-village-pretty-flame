Lepa sela lepo gore (1995)

The Yugoslavian Civil War of the 1990s is one of the most poorly understood events of recent history. Beginning with the 10-Day War in the Summer of 1991, a brief conflict that killed under 100 people and ended with Slovenia gaining its independence, it quickly spiraled into the far bloodier Croatian War of Independence, which killed tens of thousands of people and displaced over 300,000 civilians, mostly Serbs. The Clinton Administration's decision to bomb Belgrade in 1999, while largely forgotten in the United States, remains a source of bitterness in Serbia, where it's largely considered a terrorist attack no different from 9/11. In any event, it solved nothing since conficts between Serbs and Albanians in North Kosovo continue to this day. But it's the Bosnian war, which took place between 1992 and 1995, and which included the massacre at Sbrebenica and the three-year-long siege of Sarajevo, that's largely responsible for the villainous reputation that Serbs enjoy in Western Europe and North America.

Lepa sela lepo gore by Srđan Dragojević, which was filmed in the breakaway Republika Srpska in territory controlled by Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić, makes no attempt to deny atrocities committed by the Republika Srpska or Yugoslavian armies during the civil war in Bosnia. Quite the contrary, the title, roughly translated as "pretty villages burn beautifully," a quote from Louis Ferdinand Celine's autobiographical novel Long Day's Journey into Night, refers to the Serbian practice of burning down Muslim villages to drive out, and ethnically cleanse, their inhabitants. But it does push back against the idea so beloved in the United States and Western Europe that the Bosnian War was a simplistic melodrama of good versus evil, of innocent Muslims victimized by bestial Orthodox Christians. Like William Tecumseh Sherman in his famous letter to his Confederate rival John Bell Hood, Lepa sela lepo gore rubs our faces in the brutality of war, especially civil war. 

"You cannot qualify war in harsher terms than I will," Sherman wrote. "War is cruelty, and you cannot refine it; and those who brought war into our country deserve all the curses and maledictions a people can pour out. I know I had no hand in making this war, and I know I will make more sacrifices to-day than any of you to secure peace. But you cannot have peace and a division of our country. If the United States submits to a division now, it will not stop, but will go on until we reap the fate of Mexico, which is eternal war. The United States does and must assert its authority, wherever it once had power; for, if it relaxes one bit to pressure, it is gone, and I believe that such is the national feeling."

The main difference between Sherman, Radovan Karadžić, Ratko Mladić, and Phillip Sheridan is that Karadžić and Mladić were on the losing side. To this day, William Tecsumseh Sherman is utterly loathed in the South for burning Atlanta, and certainly would have been hanged as a war criminal had the Confederacy prevailed. Lepa sela lepo gore, however, lacks Sherman's unshakable conviction that his brutality was in the service of saving a noble experiments from the agents of chaos and reaction. Not only is Srđan Dragojević unclear about exactly "who started it," he has no real confidence that Yugoslavia was even worth saving in the first place. In the end he seems to echo Ashely Wilkes from Gone with the Wind. "Most of miseries of the world were caused by wars, and when the wars were over no-one ever knew what they were about.""
