Lepa sela lepo gore (1995)

The Yugoslavian Civil War of the 1990s is one of the most poorly understood events of recent history. Beginning with the 10-Day War in the Summer of 1991, a brief conflict that killed under 100 people and ended with Slovenia gaining its independence, it quickly spiraled into the far bloodier Croatian War of Independence, which killed tens of thousands of people and displaced over 300,000 civilians, mostly Serbs. The Clinton Administration's decision to bomb Belgrade in 1999, while largely forgotten in the United States, remains a source of bitterness in Serbia, where it's largely considered a terrorist attack no different from 9/11. In any event, it solved nothing since conficts between Serbs and Albanians in North Kosovo continue to this day. But it's the Bosnian war, which took place between 1992 and 1995, and which included the massacre at Sbrebenica and the three-year-long siege of Sarajevo, that's largely responsible for the villainous reputation that Serbs enjoy in Western Europe and North America.

Lepa sela lepo gore by Srđan Dragojević, which was filmed in the breakaway Republika Srpska in territory controlled by the convicted Serbian war criminal Radovan Karadžić, makes no attempt to deny atrocities committed by the Republika Srpska or Yugoslavian armies during the horrific civil war, but it does strongly push back against the idea that it was a war of good against evil, of innocent Muslims victimized by bestial Orthodox Christians. Rather, to quote Ashley Wilkes from Gone with the Wind, it was proof that "most of the evils of the world have been caused by wars, and when they were over, nobody ever remembered what they were about."
